# Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to display the ratings I gave myself for my data science profile.  There were 7 categories, each rated between 1 and 5 (1 being weak in that category, 5 being high).  The ratings I assigned myself are as follows:

Computer Programming: 4
Math: 5
Statistics: 3
Machine Learning: 3
Domain Expertise: 4
Communication and Presentation Skills: 4
Data Visualization: 2

# Organization

All files are located in the DataScienceProfile directory.  I had intended to add a directory to contain files for McGee's stat6306datascience repo, but this repository does not exist on GitHub and has therefore been omitted.

# Reproducing the Output

To reproduce the histogram, simply source the MakeHistogram.R file in an R command console.
